          <h1>Architect of Global Impact and Ethical Leadership</h1>
          <p>
            Ratan Tata, born on December 28, 1937, in Bombay, India, is a
            visionary industrialist and philanthropist renowned for transforming
            the Tata Group into a global conglomerate. Graduating from Cornell
            University and later attending Harvard Business School, Tata started
            his career on the shop floor of Tata Steel, gradually ascending the
            corporate ladder. In 1991, he assumed leadership as Chairman of the
            Tata Group, steering it through significant expansions and
            acquisitions, including the landmark purchase of Jaguar Land Rover.
            Tata's commitment to ethical business practices, innovation, and
            corporate social responsibility has left an indelible mark. Beyond
            business, his dedication to societal welfare is evident in
            initiatives like the Tata Trusts. A man of integrity and foresight,
            Ratan Tata's influence extends far beyond boardrooms, embodying a
            legacy of leadership and impact on a global scale.
